            <p>Coding process for a simulator of Foucault's panopticon, done in Mu (a developing environment with a white background and black text). Suspenseful techno music plays in the background, occasionally trading off for a clacky keyboard. Occasionally, the normal black and white will shift to X-ray-type filter, to illustrate certain crucial lines of code that underlie the Panopticon's function. At the end, the code is run. A high-pitched beep sounds with each decision made by the player, sounding faster and faster to show the inescapability of the Panopticon.</p>

            <p>Soundscape playing on the idea of a literal train of thought. It starts with a study session, before fading into the fantastical representation of this train of thought. The guiding voice comes through a PA system, welcoming "passing thoughts". Stops include "rationalization station" (for Worries to be processed), and "inclination station" (for Impulse Thoughts to be acted on). The train ride, however, is soon interrupted by a Brainstorm. This fades out as we return to our real-life study session, the sounds of keyboard clacking more intense as the brainstorm kicks in.</p>
