00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.143
[A light is switched on, and a notebook is opened to a fresh page. There is light pencil scribbling, and lo-fi music in the background]

00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:13.586
[Computer keyboard typing is layered over lo-fi music]

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:19.729
[Lo-fi music fades out, and the sound of a train chugging along the tracks fades in. The train whistle signals its arrival into the scene.]

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:28.157
[intercom chime of a public announcement, followed by a voice coming through speakers] Welcome aboard the Train of Thought, lay-ideas and gentle-musings. 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.729
It is our sincerest pleasure to have you traveling as Passing Thoughts with us today.

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:38.500
I do see we are prone to our more anxious passing thoughts as usual... 

00:00:38.614 --> 00:00:45.143
[exasperated tone] And I see you’ve all already made yourselves quite comfortable running laps around the train car.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:56.369
[sound of feet running up and down the train] …Excellent. No matter! The time is 9:57am, and we are thankfully due to arrive at Rationalization Station shortly.

00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:07.043
Please stand by for further announcements. [train slows, brakes screeching]

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:13.300
Attention all passing thoughts, we have arrived at Rationalization Station right on schedule.

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:19.071
 It is asked that any Worries may de-board for processing here. Thank you. [train doors open]

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.071
[distorted, dream-like voices of Worried Thoughts as they de-board the train] We are so going to fail this essay...

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.596
...This thesis statement makes no sense...

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:30.657
[train doors shut, and train chugging picks up as the train leaves the station]

00:01:30.743 --> 00:01:34.057
[announcer comes back over the PA system] Our next stop is Inclination Station. 

00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:42.221
Any Impulsive Thoughts wishing to be acted on are advised to be ready for departure within the next five minutes. Thank you.

00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:44.657
[distorted, dream-like voices of Impulsive Thoughts on the train] What if we cut our hair?...

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:51.486
...Or dye it purple?!... Maybe we could drop out of school, to join the circus!

00:01:52.314 --> 00:02:02.314
[announcer cuts in over the PA system] Uh, lay-ideas and gentle-musings, I'm afraid we may experience some delays in our arrival to Inclination Station. It appears we are entering a *brainstorm.*

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.335
[thunder crashes dramatically twice]

00:02:05.343 --> 00:02:17.831
[announcer] It is advised that you kindly shut your windows and hang on tight. [Windows shut around the train]

00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:31.071
[Rain fades out, and lo-fi music and furious keyboard clacking fades back in]

00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:40.571
[pencil scribbling on paper, then a page turn, followed by more scribbling]

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:42.400
[The notebook is shut, and the light is switched off]
