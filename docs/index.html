            <div class='R-bio'>
              <p>I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design on the Online Media track. My education involves a hybrid focus between the writing and design skills that go into creating digital content, as well as the coding and data analysis skills to build the software that can display said content. My love of design does not stop with school though, as I spend my spare time reading my way through a never-ending list of books on the many subconsiderations of design. You&#8217;ll find some of my main interests (<em>and perhaps a couple of book recommendations for each one</em>) below.</p>

              <h3>accessibility</h3>
                <p>My biggest passion is making my work accessible. I have sought out supplemental disability-related design readings and tools, like WebAIM&#8217;s contrast checker and WAVE Tool, that allow me to check if my projects are inclusive to the disability community. Inspired by books like <em>Mismatch</em> by Kat Holmes and <em>What Can a Body Do?</em> by Sara Hendren, I have come to strongly believe in the need for design that adapts to bodies, rather than forcing bodies to adapt to the design.</p>

              <h3>design</h3>
                <p>My skillset currently includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Audacity. Outside of software skills, I have formal training in typographic principles. But I&#8217;m always looking to expand. I round out my major's education with a self-guided education in the ethics of inclusive design, with books such as <em>Design Justice</em>, written by Sasha Costanza-Chock and <em>Extra Bold</em>, written by a brilliant collective of designers including Ellen Lupton and Jennifer Tobias.</p>

              <img src='./icons/coding.png' height='35'/>
              <h3>writing</h3>
                <p>Whether it is a narrative or a program, I really enjoy the writing process. Specifically with coding, I &ldquo;speak&rdquo; HTML, CSS, Python, and Java. With creative writing, books like <em>Brand Thinking</em> by Debbie Millman and <em>User Friendly</em> by Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant have shown me the link between narrative and how we understand design. I am endlessly fascinated by the power of the stories we tell ourselves and aim to work on more projects where I can hone my own storytelling abilities.</p>
