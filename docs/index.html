      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, with a B.A. in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (Online Media track) and a certificate in Disability Studies. My education hasn&#8217;t stopped since graduating though, and continues to involve a hybrid focus between the writing and design skills that go into creating digital content, as well as the coding and data analysis skills to build the software that can display said content. I spend my spare time reading my way through a never-ending list of books on the many subconsiderations of design. You&#8217;ll find some of my main interests (<em>and perhaps a couple of book recommendations for each one</em>) below.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>accessibility</h3>
        <p>As a disabled designer, my biggest passion is making my work inclusive to the disability community. In both my work as an educator (<a href='./teaching.html'>access my teaching portfolio</a>) and as a designer (<a href='./design.html'>access my design portfolio</a>), I believe in accessibility as more than a checklist. Beyond having an understanding of accessibility standards, I aim to be mindful of the complexities of access intimacy and create holistic, emotionally-considerate access (which is an ever-evolving and imperfect practice).</p>
        <p>Inspired by books like <em>Mismatch</em> by Kat Holmes and <em>What Can a Body Do?</em> by Sara Hendren, I strongly believe in co-design practices to create designs that adapt to bodies' diverse ways of being, rather than forcing bodies to adapt to the design.</p>

        <h3>design</h3>
        <p>My skillset currently includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Figma, Twine, and Audacity. Outside of software skills, I have formal training in typographic principles. But I&#8217;m always looking to expand.</p> 
                  
        <p>Between my time in my major, starting up a podcast, and working as an intern for Pitt's Digital Media Lab, I developed the skills required to be constantly learning new tech/software.</p>
        
        <p>But design is more than the things we make. It is about who our designs include or exclude (recognizing that this inclusion/exclusion is not a simple binary, but complicated by intersectionality, as well as visibility of identities). With this in mind, I also pursue a self-guided education into the ethics of design, with the help of books such as <em>Design Justice</em>, written by Sasha Costanza-Chock and <em>Extra Bold</em>, written by a brilliant collective of designers including Ellen Lupton and Jennifer Tobias.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>writing</h3>
        <p>Whether it is a narrative or a program, I really enjoy the writing process. Specifically with coding, I &ldquo;speak&rdquo; HTML, CSS, Python, and Java. At times in my work, like the Panopticon simulator I made for my Digital Humanity class (featured in my <a aria-label='Go to design portfolio' href='./design.html#av'>design portfolio</a>), code meets narrative quite directly.</p> 
                  
        <p>With creative writing, books like <em>Brand Thinking</em> by Debbie Millman and <em>User Friendly</em> by Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant have shown me the link between narrative and how we understand design. My work as host and producer of <em>Welcomed by Design</em> (refer to my <a aria-label='Go to teaching portfolio' href='./teaching.html'>teaching portfolio</a>) has allowed me to put my understanding of this connection into practice. I am endlessly fascinated by the power of the stories we tell ourselves through our words and design. Heading into my postgrad life, I aim to work on more projects where I can hone my own storytelling abilities.</p>
