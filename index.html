          <h2>about</h2>
          <p>I am a University of Pittsburgh graduate, with a B.A. in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (Online Media track) and a certificate in Disability Studies. Through this education, I gained a hybrid skillset that includes writing, design, coding, and data analysis&mdash; which helps immensely with communicating across multidisciplinary team roles.</p>

          <p>Currently, I work in design education as a freelance digital designer. Whether the topic at hand is theoretical or technical, I love creating engaging learning experiences through playful instructional design. I mainly create and facilitate workshops and guest lectures for the University of Pittsburgh, and I am also co-director of the DISCO/"Design a Spaceship" inclusive design OER toolkit project alongside Dr. Jessica FitzPatrick. Regardless of the specific project, I bring my focus on accessibility to everything I do.</p> 
          
          <p>Since graduating, I have continued my education around freelance projects. I recently passed the International Association of Accessibility Professional (IAAP) exam to become a Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (<a aria-label="Go to Lynn Priestley's CPACC certification" href="https://www.credly.com/badges/493a591d-1549-4da5-8058-f6bdd07f7b0c/public_url">CPACC</a>). In addition to the Continuing Education now required to stay certified, I spend my spare time reading my way through a never-ending list of books on disability studies, design, and the intersection of both fields. You&#8217;ll find some of my main interests (and perhaps a couple of book recommendations for each one) below.</p>
          
          <p>I&#8217;d love to bring my passion for accessibility and playful design to the digital work you need designed. <a href="./contact.html">Go to my connect page</a> to get in touch with me.</p>

          <h3>accessibility</h3>
          <p>As a disabled designer, my biggest passion is making my work inclusive to the disability community. In both my work as an educator and as a designer, I believe in accessibility as more than a checklist. Beyond having an understanding of accessibility standards, I aim to be mindful of the complexities of access intimacy and create holistic, emotionally-considerate access (which is an ever-evolving and imperfect practice). I also firmly believe that accessible design doesn&#8217;t have to mean "boring design", and I love nothing more than creating experiences that are both accessible and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
          
          <p>Inspired by books like <em>Mismatch</em> by Kat Holmes and <em>What Can a Body Do?</em> by Sara Hendren, I strongly believe in co-design practices to create designs that adapt to bodies&#8217; diverse ways of being, rather than forcing bodies to adapt to the design.</p>

          <h3>design</h3>
          <p>My skillset currently includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Figma, Twine, and Audacity. I am also skilled in generating accessible PDFs of my designs through use of Adobe Acrobat. Outside of software skills, I have formal training in typographic principles. But I&#8217;m always looking to expand.</p>         
          
          <p>During my time studying <abbr title="Digital Narrative and Interactive Design">DNID</abbr>, starting a podcast, and working as an intern for Pitt's Digital Media Lab, I developed the skills required to be constantly learning new tech/software.</p>
          
          <p>But design is about more than the things we make. It is about who our designs include or exclude. With this in mind, I also pursue self-guided education into the ethics of design, with the help of books such as <em>Design Justice</em>, written by Sasha Costanza-Chock and <em>Extra Bold</em>, written by a brilliant collective of designers including Ellen Lupton and Jennifer Tobias.</p>

          <h3>writing</h3>
          <p>Whether it is a program or a narrative, I really enjoy the writing process. Specifically with coding, I &ldquo;speak&rdquo; (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> compliant) HTML/CSS, Python, and Java. At times in my work, like the Panopticon simulator I made for my Digital Humanity class (featured in my <a aria-label='Go to audio/video project section in design portfolio' href='./design.html#av'>design portfolio</a>), code meets narrative quite directly.</p> 
                    
          <p>With creative writing in mind, books like <em>Brand Thinking</em> by Debbie Millman and <em>User Friendly</em> by Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant have shown me the link between narrative and how we understand design. My work as host and producer of <em>Welcomed by Design</em> (refer to my <a aria-label='Go to podcast section in teaching portfolio' href='./teaching.html#pod'>teaching portfolio</a>) has allowed me to put my understanding of this connection into practice. I am endlessly fascinated by the power of the stories we tell ourselves through our words and design. In my postgrad life, I aim to work on more projects where I can hone my own storytelling abilities.</p>
