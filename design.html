            <p>Coding process for a simulator of Foucault&#8217;s panopticon, done in Mu (a developing environment with a white background and black text). Suspenseful techno music plays in the background, occasionally trading off for a clacky keyboard. At times, the normal black and white will shift to X-ray-type filter, to illustrate certain crucial lines of code that underlie the Panopticon's function. At the end, the code is run. A high-pitched beep sounds with each decision made by the player, sounding faster and faster to show the inescapability of the Panopticon.</p>
