- First, get sense of rhetorical situation
    - Purpose: trying to raise interest
    - Audience: person hiring
    - Context/occasion
- Reverse engineering approach
    - Work backwards from job type you want
        - Identify what they’re looking for in role
            - Look at company culture on their websites/through application process
                - Values
                - Aesthetic
        - Do you have work that mimics that?
        - Craft story of portfolio around that to show you can fit
- General advice for structuring portfolios
    - Simple
    - Easy to navigate
    - Unified
    - Central message
    - Show personality
- Website can be good way to demonstrate skills
    - Assume more general audience with web presence
    - Professional but personality-showing photos
    - Make it clean/easy to navigate
    - Adobe spark (free <3) could also be useful for creating digital portfolio?
- Update resume with each new experience
- USE PERSONAL WORK IN PORTFOLIO
    - Can do (specified as non-commissioned) spec work and do mock-ups for diff brands
- Behance and Dribble = useful for graphic design portfolio inspiration

Creative writing notes:
- Don’t post previously-unpublished work online, will mess with future opportunities
- Writing website: bio w/ edu + work experience, links to writing if have published clips OR list of experience (classes taken, approach to writing/style, goals), contact form
- Break different writing mediums into different tabs
- Upload a resume or CV but REMOVE HOME ADDRESS AND PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER
- Contact info needs to be easy to find (towards top)
